<h2>"WantToLearn" Learning Management System for Schools</h2>
<p>When I was in high school, there was constant talk about my schoolâ€™s budget and the cost of education. As I grew older, I realized just how expensive it had has become to educate children in Egypt.</p>
<p>In order to aid in this cost reduction while still maintaining order on the technology front, there are plenty of free school management software options to choose from.
This was the purpose for this project, it is building LMS for schools that handles students educational experience using technology.</p>
<p>"WantToLearn" (Project Name) offers unlimited administration and student logins to use their system, along with unlimited courses and batches. The system was developed using ASP.NET MVC Framework. This system includes students, Teachers, and Admins.</p>

<h3>Students:</h3>
<p>Stduents use this system to access their lessons and courses, know some information about teachers of their courses. it is user-friendly system for stduents to learn on.
unfortunately, it doesn't handle courses content as PDFs and PPTs. But students will have access to links to download content on other drives such as google drive. students will be able to communicate with teachers of the courses they attend because Email and Phone info is available to them.</p>

<h3>Teachers</h3>
<p>Teachers use this system to access the courses they assigned to. Teacher can view the details and edit the courses content. Teachers coommunnicate with students attending students attending one of their courses. But teachers don't have the authority to either edit student information or access the information of students on other courses.</p>

<h3>Administrator</h3>
<p>Administrators are fundemental block in this system. They have the access to courses to create and edit them as well as students and teachers information to view only (they are not authorized to change the information entered by users). Admins have access to orginaze the system without changing the system which secure the users right to have fair educational experience.</p>
